Benchmark for single-page parsing
We ship two comprehensive benchmarks to help measure the performance of our OCR system in single-page parsing:

OCRFlux-bench-single: Containing 2000 pdf pages (1000 English pages and 1000 Chinese pages) and their ground-truth Markdowns (manually labeled with multi-round check).

OCRFlux-pubtabnet-single: Derived from the public PubTabNet benchmark with some format transformation. It contains 9064 HTML table samples, which are split into simple tables and complex tables according to whether they have rowspan and colspan cells.

We emphasize that the released benchmarks are NOT included in our training and evaluation data. The following is the main result:

In OCRFlux-bench-single, we calculated the Edit Distance Similarity (EDS) between the generated Markdowns and the ground-truth Markdowns as the metric.

Language	Model	Avg EDS ↑
English	olmOCR-7B-0225-preview	0.885
Nanonets-OCR-s	0.870
MonkeyOCR	0.828
OCRFlux-3B	0.971

Nanonets-OCR-s	0.846
MonkeyOCR	0.731
OCRFlux-3B	0.962
Total	olmOCR-7B-0225-preview	0.872
Nanonets-OCR-s	0.858
MonkeyOCR	0.780
OCRFlux-3B	0.967
In OCRFlux-pubtabnet-single, we calculated the Tree Edit Distance-based Similarity (TEDS) between the generated HTML tables and the ground-truth HTML tables as the metric.

Type	Model	Avg TEDS ↑
Simple	olmOCR-7B-0225-preview	0.810
Nanonets-OCR-s	0.882

Nanonets-OCR-s	0.828
MonkeyOCR	0.853
OCRFlux-3B	0.861
We also conduct some case studies to show the superiority of our model in the blog article.

Benchmark for cross-page table/paragraph merging
PDF documents are typically paginated, which often results in tables or paragraphs being split across consecutive pages. Accurately detecting and merging such cross-page structures is crucial to avoid generating incomplete or fragmented content.

The detection task can be formulated as follows: given the Markdowns of two consecutive pages—each structured as a list of Markdown elements (e.g., paragraphs and tables)—the goal is to identify the indexes of elements that should be merged across the pages.

Then for the merging task, if the elements to be merged are paragraphs, we can just concate them. However, for two table fragments, their merging is much more challenging. For example, the table spanning multiple pages will repeat the header of the first page on the second page. Another difficult scenario is that the table cell contains long content that spans multiple lines within the cell, with the first few lines appearing on the previous page and the remaining lines continuing on the next page. We also observe some cases where tables with a large number of columns are split vertically and placed on two consecutive pages. More examples of cross-page tables can be found in our blog article. To address these issues, we develop the LLM model for cross-page table merging. Specifically, this model takes two split table fragments as input and generates a complete, well-structured table as output.

We ship two comprehensive benchmarks to help measure the performance of our OCR system in cross-page table/paragraph detection and merging tasks respectively:

OCRFlux-bench-cross: Containing 1000 samples (500 English samples and 500 Chinese samples), each sample contains the Markdown element lists of two consecutive pages, along with the indexes of elements that need to be merged (manually labeled through multiple rounds of review). If no tables or paragraphs require merging, the indexes in the annotation data are left empty.

OCRFlux-pubtabnet-cross: Containing 9064 pairs of split table fragments, along with their corresponding ground-truth merged versions.

The released benchmarks are NOT included in our training and evaluation data neither. The following is the main result:

In OCRFlux-bench-cross, we caculated the Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 score as the metric. Notice that the detection results are right only when it accurately judges whether there are elements that need to be merged across the two pages and output the right indexes of them.

Language	Precision ↑	Recall ↑	F1 ↑	Accuracy ↑
English	0.992	0.964	0.978	0.978
Chinese	1.000	0.988	0.994	0.994
Total	0.996	0.976	0.986	0.986
In OCRFlux-pubtabnet-cross, we calculate the Tree Edit Distance-based Similarity (TEDS) between the generated merged table and the ground-truth merged table as the metric.

Complex	0.935
Total	0.950
Installation
Requirements:

Recent NVIDIA GPU (tested on RTX 3090, 4090, L40S, A100, H100) with at least 12 GB of GPU RAM
20GB of free disk space
You will need to install poppler-utils and additional fonts for rendering PDF images.

Install dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils poppler-data ttf-mscorefonts-installer msttcorefonts fonts-crosextra-caladea fonts-crosextra-carlito gsfonts lcdf-typetools
Set up a conda environment and install OCRFlux. The requirements for running OCRFlux are difficult to install in an existing python environment, so please do make a clean python environment to install into.

conda create -n ocrflux python=3.11
conda activate ocrflux

git clone https://github.com/chatdoc-com/OCRFlux.git
cd OCRFlux

pip install -e . --find-links https://flashinfer.ai/whl/cu124/torch2.5/flashinfer/
Local Usage Example
For quick testing, try the web demo. To run locally, a GPU is required, as inference is powered by vllm under the hood.

For a pdf document:

python -m ocrflux.pipeline ./localworkspace --data test.pdf --model /model_dir/OCRFlux-3B
For an image:

python -m ocrflux.pipeline ./localworkspace --data test_page.png --model /model_dir/OCRFlux-3B
For a directory of pdf or images:

python -m ocrflux.pipeline ./localworkspace --data test_pdf_dir/* --model /model_dir/OCRFlux-3B
You can set --skip_cross_page_merge to skip the cross-page merging in the parsing process to accelerate, it would simply concatenate the parsing results of each page to generate final Markdown of the document.

Results will be stored as JSONL files in the ./localworkspace/results directory.

Each line in JSONL files is a json object with the following fields:

{
    "orig_path": str,  # the path to the raw pdf or image file
    "num_pages": int,  # the number of pages in the pdf file
    "document_text": str, # the Markdown text of the converted pdf or image file
    "page_texts": dict, # the Markdown texts of each page in the pdf file, the key is the page index and the value is the Markdown text of the page
    "fallback_pages": [int], # the page indexes that are not converted successfully
}
API for directly calling OCRFlux (New)
You can use the inference API to directly call OCRFlux in your codes without using an online vllm server like following:

from vllm import LLM
from ocrflux.inference import parse

file_path = 'test.pdf'
# file_path = 'test.png'
llm = LLM(model="model_dir/OCRFlux-3B",gpu_memory_utilization=0.8,max_model_len=8192)
result = parse(llm,file_path)
if result != None:
    document_markdown = result['document_text']
    print(document_markdown)
    with open('test.md','w') as f:
        f.write(document_markdown)
else:
    print("Parse failed.")
If parsing is failed or there are fallback pages in the result, you can try to set the argument max_page_retries for the parse function with a positive integer to get a better result. But it may cause longer inference time.

Local Deployment (New)
Run the following command to start the server:

bash ocrflux/server.sh /path/to/model port
For example, the following command:

bash ocrflux/server.sh ChatDOC/OCRFlux-3B 30024
It will start a vllm server on port 30024. You can also start server by yourself using other methods like sglang.

After the server is started, you can use the request api to request it to parse a pdf file or an image file like following:

import asyncio
from argparse import Namespace
from ocrflux.client import request
args = Namespace(
    model="/path/to/OCRFlux-3B",
    skip_cross_page_merge=False,
    max_page_retries=1,
    url="http://localhost",
    port=30024,
)
file_path = 'test.pdf'
# file_path = 'test.png'
result = asyncio.run(request(args,file_path))
if result != None:
    document_markdown = result['document_text']
    print(document_markdown)
    with open('test.md','w') as f:
        f.write(document_markdown)
else:
    print("Parse failed.")
Docker Usage
Requirements:

Docker with GPU support (NVIDIA Toolkit)
Pre-downloaded model: OCRFlux-3B
To use OCRFlux in a docker container, you can use the following example command to start the docker container firstly:

docker run -it --gpus all \
  -v /path/to/localworkspace:/localworkspace \
  -v /path/to/test_pdf_dir:/test_pdf_dir \
  -v /path/to/OCRFlux-3B:/OCRFlux-3B \
  --entrypoint bash \
  chatdoc/ocrflux:latest
and then run the following command on the docker container to parse document files:

python3.12 -m ocrflux.pipeline /localworkspace/ocrflux_results --data /test_pdf_dir/*.pdf --model /OCRFlux-3B/
The parsing results will be stored in /localworkspace/ocrflux_results directory. Run the following command to generate the final Markdown files:

python -m ocrflux.jsonl_to_markdown ./localworkspace/ocrflux_results
Viewing Results
Generate the final Markdown files by running the following command. Generated Markdown files will be in ./localworkspace/markdowns/DOCUMENT_NAME directory.

python -m ocrflux.jsonl_to_markdown ./localworkspace
